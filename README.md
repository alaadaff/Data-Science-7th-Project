# Data-Science-7th-Project

The purpose of this assignment is to apply different visualization models and techniques to get a better insight on the data and establish additional value. The dataset used in this assignment was obtained from: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/soccer-spi

Additional features were created to get a sense of who won a given match, who lost or whether the match ended with a draw. In addition, another feature was introduced to differentiate between the winning/losing team according to whether a team was playing at home or away.
